This is the Tic-Tac-Toe assignment as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this project was to create a game of Tic-tac-toe with as little global code as possible by using modules or factory functions.

🪲 BUGS 🪲

- 'Hard' AI opponent does not work, particularly an issue with the minimax function which I was unable to debug. The function is returning an undefined score only some of the times, while other times, it properly returns the correct score. See the script.js file lines 365 - 373 in the if/else block within the loop where I left a comment stating the undefined error.
